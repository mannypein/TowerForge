# What the site models — and what's missing

The whole game, system by system, against what TowerForge models (written 2026-10-18; rows updated as systems are added, last reviewed 2026-10-23).
✅ modeled · ◐ partly · ✗ not yet. "Calibrated" means the player's own battle
reports set the baseline, so even unmodeled effects are already in it; only
*changing* them isn't valued. Details of each model: [optimizer.md](optimizer.md),
[run-simulation.md](run-simulation.md), [ultimate-weapons.md](ultimate-weapons.md),
[module-effects.md](module-effects.md).

## Damage

| System | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tower damage, attack speed, crit, super crit, Damage/Meter, range | ✅ | towerDamage.ts; workshop, labs, cards, masteries, enhancements, relics, modules. Damage/Meter on tower shots since 2026-10-19 (1 + DPM × distance, shots at half the range on average — the code's assumption); before that it only fed Spotlight+ |
| Multishot, Bounce Shot, Rapid Fire | ✅ | Averages (2026-10-18); give Chain Lightning, tower shots and Smite more hits |
| Rend Armor | ◐ | In the tower-shots share; Rend chance/mult upgrades aren't modeled on their own |
| All 9 UWs + UW+ | ✅ | uwdps.ts; Golden Tower for coins only |
| Flame Bot | ✅ | From the run's FlameBotDamage (2026-10-18): ×Damage × tower damage × crits ÷ cooldown; burn stacks and Wild Fire (Bot+) not modeled. Its Damage Reduction counts for eHP survival (2026-10-23), by the share of hits the run shows it covering |
| Amplify Bot, Bot Bot | ✅ | Tower damage multiplier |
| Echoing Shot (Amplify Bot+) | ◐ | Since 2026-10-19: tower shots × the bullets each counts as (3 + level, up to 12), always on like Amplify Bot's Bonus (uptime and range aren't modeled). The wiki's 1/3 boost for UW projectiles isn't modeled |
| Other Bot+ abilities: Wild Fire, Titan Shock, Bonus Cells, Maximum Power | ✗ | Levels entered or imported (v29 tables, 2026-10-19) but not valued: Wild Fire's Enflamed bonus lasts by Flame Bot damage, Titan Shock needs enemy attack speed, Bonus Cells needs elite cells per run, and how Maximum Power boosts the other abilities (whole value or the part above 1) isn't confirmed |
| Death Ray card | ◐ | Read from runs and shown; kills what it touches (not bosses or protected enemies), so it isn't flat damage; its upgrades (Double Death Ray lab) aren't valued |
| Guardian Attack chip | ◐ | From the run's GuardianDamage (2026-10-20): scales with Percentage × Targets ÷ Cooldown and with the health the rest of the damage takes off (it hits a share of lost health), so it counts for damage and run length. Assumes its targets are about as hurt as in the run; the boss half-damage mix stays as in the run |
| Electrons, Spotlight damage | ◐ | Read from runs and shown, kept fixed |
| Guardian (2026-10-19) | ◐ | Gear → Guardian; imported from the export (chips, presets, slots, skins). Scout → tower shots through Damage/Meter; Attack → its share of the run's damage (row above); Bounty, Summon → kill coins; Fetch → its coins and loot by finds per second; skins +0.6% coins each. Ally (overheal past Max Recovery) not counted — how it combines with the usual cap isn't confirmed |
| Orbs, thorns, land mines | ◐ | Fixed share for damage; orbs and thorns modeled for coins / survival. Waves (2026-10-22): orbs and Death Ray stopping more of the run-ending enemies they can touch (Tank, Ranged…) as enemies stay in range longer; orb count, speed and size since 2026-10-23 (orbs.ts, wiki values), for eHP too (fewer enemies reach the tower). Vault orbs and Sentry Protocol not counted |
| Demon Mode, Plasma Cannon, Berserker, Super Tower | ◐ | Berserker and Super Tower in the model; Demon Mode and Plasma Cannon aren't |
| Protectors' damage reduction (55%) | ◐ | Inside the calibration; the Protector labs aren't valued |

## How long enemies are in range (time to tower)

| System | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Range, Chrono Field slow and uptime, Chrono Loop (CF+), Slow Aura | ✅ | ttt.ts; every source counts per enemy pass (2026-10-18) |
| Thunder Bot stun and linger | ✗ | Wiki: stun on a cooldown, half as effective on bosses and elites, linger slow after. Needs where the bot sits and how its area meets the tower's range |
| Poison Swamp / Inner Land Mine / Land Mine stuns, Energy Net | ✗ | Stuns weaken on the same enemy ("stun debt", TheTowerSDK); needs in-game timings |
| Knockback, Shockwave | ✗ | Push = force ÷ enemy mass, and mass grows with waves (wiki, SDK); weak on late-wave elites, but unmeasured |

## Enemies and how far a run gets

| System | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Health/damage per wave and tier, elites, fleets, bosses, speeds | ✅ | enemyStats.ts — matches the in-game Wave Info panel at T18 |
| Enemy Level Skip (health and attack) | ✅ | levelSkip.ts; workshop, lab, enhancement, relic, substats |
| Enemy health labs | ✅ | By how often each type ends your runs (KilledBy) |
| Enemy mix of normal types | ◐ | Not confirmed; doesn't change the push ranking |
| Run length (Glass Cannon) | ✅ | runLength.ts — your last 5 deaths, luck-averaged, with the spread shown |
| Run length for tanky builds | ✅ | eHP (2026-10-23): runs end where enemy attack outgrows survival — Run Length's eHP view, waves on the Optimizer's survival rows and in What If, Enemy Attack Level Skip and enemy attack labs scored. Checked on eHP players' saved runs (run-simulation.md); campaign only, and runs that end to single huge hits are flagged as Glass Cannon-like |
| Death Defy, Energy Shield, Second Wind, Demon Mode / Nuke automation | ◐ | Counts read from each run ("Saved by", 2026-10-18); Death Defy valued as killing hits survived (exact chance math), not yet as waves. A recording of a push's end (2026-10-19) showed the last hits come in bursts once the wall breaks, so Death Defy's waves come from earlier leaks — needs when in a run it fires |
| Wall | ◐ | eHP only. For Glass Cannon at the end of a push the wall blocks one hit per rebuild (any hit is lethal, ~1e21 vs ~3e14 health — recording 2026-10-19), so Wall Rebuild matters and Wall Health doesn't; not modeled yet |
| Tournaments and battle conditions | ◐ | Tournament waves from your tournament deaths on the tournament health curve; Tournament page: every condition's strength by wave (heat) and each league's fixed conditions. In waves (2026-10-20): UW Durations, Boss's Ultimate, Enemy Speed, Armored Enemies, More Enemies, Orb / Death Ray Resistance, Tank's, Basic's and Fast's Ultimate, Skip Reduction, Skip Decay; Death Defy Down and Energy Shields Down as killing hits survived; the rest have no effect on a Glass Cannon run (why on the page). Each run's conditions ticked once and kept (the export doesn't record them); the build used for tournaments; best module loadout for the week; no coins per run for tournaments. Tournaments → History (2026-10-21): every tournament from the export's TournamentRecords — waves and rank over time by league, league moves, per-league numbers. Model details: run-simulation.md §3 |
| Dissonance runs | ✗ | Not in the export the site reads |

## Economy

| System | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Coins per kill and wave, tier multiplier, Golden Tower / Combo, Black Hole, Spotlight, Death Wave, Golden Bot coin bonuses, Wave Skip, Critical Coin | ✅ | farming.ts + runCoins.ts, calibrated on your runs |
| Coins per run and per hour as runs get longer | ✅ | Coins per Run projection |
| Cells, gems, medals, reroll and module shards per run | ◐ | Read from your runs (2026-10-18, Coins per Run page); upgrades that raise them (Cells / Kill enhancement, DW cell bonus, Cells card) aren't valued |
| Guardian fetch | ✅ | In the run drops; its coins are a separate share of the run's coins, scaled by the Fetch chip's finds per second |
| In-run cash, interest, free upgrades, perks picked in a run | ✗ | The site assumes AFK runs; the calibration includes what you usually pick |

## Spending

| Currency | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Coins: workshop, enhancements | ✅ | Game cost tables, discount labs |
| Lab time | ✅ | Per hour of research; lab speed and relic |
| Stones: UWs, UW+, masteries, assist modules | ✅ | Bot+ (1,250 stones) not offered |
| Medals: bots, Bot+, Event Shop trades | ✅ | Bots and Bot+ levels (to v29's 20–25, 2026-10-19) only where a model reads the stat — Echoing Shot among the Bot+ abilities |
| Module Shards: slot levels | ✅ | Shard cost lab; level caps by rarity |
| Gems: card slots | ✅ | Card pulls random; lab slots and rushes not ranked |
| Elite Cells: lab boosts | ◐ | Boost table; your cells per day now visible in run drops |
| Bits: Guardian chips | ✅ | Optimizer Bits panel: each equipped chip's next level per Bit (wiki and SDK tables; 2026-10-19). Slots and which chips to equip aren't ranked |
| Keys (Vault), Guild Tokens | ◐ | Vault levels imported (2026-10-22); only Bot Range (id 1810, 2 m a level — checked on the owner's Bots screen) is used. The rest of TheTowerSDK's vault data is marked unverified |

## What it would take to close the biggest gaps

1. **Death Defy in waves:** when in a run it fires. The end-of-push
   recording (2026-10-19) showed the last hits come in bursts after the wall
   breaks — saves there buy seconds — so what's needed is the in-run stats
   ("Death defied") at a few waves of one push.
2. **Stuns and knockback:** the wave an elite gets stunned or pushed, and
   for how long or how far, at your waves (a short recording).
3. **Cells and drops from upgrades:** with cells per run now read, the
   Cells / Kill and Death Wave cell bonuses can be valued the way coins are —
   next step.
4. **Vault:** in-game values for the trees you own. Guardian: how Ally's Max Recovery combines with the usual overheal cap, and two runs at different Attack levels to check that its damage follows Percentage × Targets ÷ Cooldown.
