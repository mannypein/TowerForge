# Ultimate Weapons — verified mechanics

What the site's UW math is based on, checked against the game wiki (2026-10-16)
and a real account's battle history. Each UW lists what was verified, how the
model uses it, and what isn't modeled. Code: `engine/uwdps.ts` (damage),
`engine/ttt.ts` (Chrono Field, time-to-tower), `engine/edps.ts` (calibrated
Glass Cannon score), `engine/farming.ts` (coins), `constants/gameData.ts`
(tables). Tests: `engine/uwdps.test.ts`, `engine/calculations.test.ts`,
`engine/optimizer.test.ts`.

**Sources** — Fandom wiki pages `the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/<Name>`
(Chain_Lightning, Smart_Missiles, Death_Wave, Chrono_Field, Inner_Land_Mines,
Golden_Tower, Poison_Swamp, Black_Hole, Spotlight, Slow_Aura, Modules,
Sub-Module_Effects) and the Tower Knowledge Hub
(`the-tower.notion.site`: Ultimate Weapons, Golden Combo (GT+), Card Mastery,
Assist Modules, Game Versions). Fandom blocks plain fetches (HTTP 402) and
Notion renders client-side, so both were read in a browser: on a fandom tab,
`fetch('/wiki/<Name>')` + `DOMParser` reads any page's tables.

## All UWs

- **Stat values and stone costs**: all 27 stats match the wiki level for
  level (`UW_STAT_VALUES`, `UW_STONE_COSTS`). The game added levels in 2025:
  Smart Missiles / Inner Land Mines / Poison Swamp Damage go to Lv 36,
  Spotlight Bonus to Lv 31, Spotlight Angle to Lv 61 (90°). Level 1 is free;
  reaching level L costs `costs[L − 2]`.
- **UW unlock costs** (by how many you own, Notion): 5, 50, 150, 300, 800,
  1250, 1750, 2400, 3000.
- **UW+ unlock costs** (global sequence, from the code — not on the wiki
  pages read; the 4th = 975 matched a real account): 500, 625, 750, 975,
  1250, 1650, 2200, 2900, 3800. UW+ only unlocks once all 9 UWs are owned.
- **UW+ level costs** — three groups (Notion tip, matches the tables):
  CF+ / BH+ / DW+ / SL+ start at 400 (400, 500, 610, 730, 860, 1000, 1150,
  1300, 1500, 1700, 1950, 2200, 2450, 2700); CL+ / SM+ / PS+ start at 300
  and scale faster (300, 375, 475, 600, 725, 925, 1150, 1450, 1800, 2200,
  2650, 3150, 3700, 4300); GT+ / ILM+ start at 300 and scale slower (300, 360,
  430, 510, 620, 750, 900, 1100, 1350, 1650, 2050, 2600, 3300, 4150).
  `upLvl` 0 = the level you get on unlock (wiki "level 0").
- **UW perks** (one each, no Standard Perk Bonus): CL damage ×2, SM +4
  missiles, DW +1 effect wave, CF +5s, ILM +6 mines (outside the wall), GT
  bonus ×1.5, PS radius ×1.5, BH +12s, SL bonus ×1.5. The model counts a UW
  perk unless it's banned.
- **Galaxy Compressor** cuts every UW cooldown except Poison Swamp's (the
  code's assumption, not checked on the wiki; `calcGCompCDReduction`, uses
  the active preset's package chance).
- **Multiverse Nexus**: Death Wave, Golden Tower and Black Hole share one
  cooldown.

## Chain Lightning (CL)

- Wiki: a % chance on each enemy hit to spawn N chain lightnings dealing a
  multiple of tower damage (crit and super crit count).
- Damage 2× → 7961× (32 levels), Quantity 1 → 5, Chance 5% → 27.5%.
- **Smite (CL+)**: every chain lightning has a chance equal to CL Chance to
  deal 0.0005× → 0.006× the current wave's enemy HP (12 levels), up to 100
  times per enemy.
- Labs: Shock (unlock: 2.5% chance, ×1.10), Shock Chance +0.5%/lv (×30),
  Shock Multiplier +0.04/lv (×14); Chain Thunder (enemy damage −10% per 6%
  HP lost to CL, max 3%/lv ×30); Lightning Amplifier – Scatter.
- Model: Damage × Quantity × Chance × fire rate × tower damage × crit ×
  perk. Shock is a damage-taken multiplier on everything. Critical Chance
  card mastery is tower crit (in the crit multiplier), not CL chance.
- **Smite in the calibrated score**: the game counts each enemy once in
  `EnemiesHitByChainLightningThisRound`, so CL hits per enemy reached =
  shots fired × CL chance × chains ÷ enemies reached, and smites per enemy =
  that × CL chance (capped at 100). On a T18 ~W8600 farming run that's about
  4.5, far below the cap.
- Not modeled: Chain Thunder (eHP), Lightning Amplifier – Scatter,
  multishot / bounce extra hits.

## Smart Missiles (SM)

- Wiki: N missiles every cooldown, tracking enemies, each a multiple of tower
  damage (crit counts). Damage 10× → 9219× (36 levels), Quantity 5 → 20,
  Cooldown 180s → 20s.
- **Cover Fire (SM+)**: one extra missile every 13s → 2s (12 levels).
- Labs: Despawn Time, Missile Amplifier (each hit on the same target adds
  2.5 → 38.5, additive), Explosion + Radius, Missile Barrage (manual, once a
  run) + Quantity + Recharge.
- Model: Damage × (Quantity × activations + Cover Fire missiles) × tower
  damage × crit.
- Not modeled: Missile Amplifier, explosion radius, Missile Barrage.

## Death Wave (DW) — reworked in v24.3

- Wiki: effect waves (count = "Effect Waves" stat, every ~4s, infinite range)
  hit every enemy, then a Death Wave with a damage pool that persists and
  carries over between activations until spent. Each effect-wave hit gives
  that enemy a damage amplifier against the Death Wave: 5× base, Damage
  Amplifier lab 6.5× → 50× (+1.5/level, 30 levels). Effect waves also give
  coins, max health (+0.05% per kill, cap from DW Health lab 525% → 1250%),
  cells, armor stripping.
- Damage 2× → 9119× (31 levels), Effect Waves 1 → 5, Cooldown 300s → 50s.
- **Kill Wall (DW+)**: each effect-wave hit adds X to the damage pool's
  multiplier: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 18, 24, 31, 39, 48, 58, 69, 81, 94, 108.
- Model: Damage × (1 + waves × amplifier) × (1 + waves × Kill Wall) ×
  activations × tower damage × crit (× a fixed 0.012 scale). Waves that land
  = min(effect waves, cooldown ÷ 4s).
- Not modeled: the pool carrying over, Kill Wall's dependence on how many
  enemies the waves hit (it scales with crowd size).

## Chrono Field (CF)

- Wiki: a field (tower range + CF Range lab 3m/level) that slows enemies.
  Speed Reduction 20% → 75% (12 levels) + module substat 3/8/11/15%, **capped
  at 90% on its own**. Duration 5s → 40s (+1s per CF Duration lab level ×30,
  +5s perk, substat 4/7/10s); Cooldown 180s → 60s (substat −4/−7/−10s).
  Fields don't stack — leftover time is wasted — so uptime = min(1,
  duration ÷ cooldown).
- **Chrono Loop (CF+)**: enemies inside the field spiral around the tower.
  Rotation 0.10 → 0.75 rad / 2s (14 levels); research (Priesten / yournicknm /
  Tremnen) puts the "hidden slow" on approach speed at 0.025, 0.05, 0.10, …,
  0.65 by level. Not a Speed Reduction stat, so not capped, but only inside
  an active field. Their formula (wiki AdvancedAnalysis, image "CF+speed",
  checked 2026-10-20): newEnemySpeed = enemySpeed × (1 + CF+ level × −0.05)
  — it matches the table at levels 1–13; the table's level 0 is 2.5% (the
  formula would give 0), and the site keeps the measured 2.5%. Test anchor in
  calculations.test.ts (speed 10 → 3.5 at level 13).
- **Slow Aura card** slows enemies in tower range and multiplies with Chrono
  Field (combined can pass 90%). Its mastery reduces enemy *attack* speed.
- Labs: Damage Reduction (unlock, 10%) + Reduction % (10.5% → 25%) while the
  field is up; CF Range.
- Model: time-to-tower = range ÷ (enemy speed × factor), factor = uptime ×
  (1 − CF)(1 − Slow Aura)(1 − Chrono Loop) + (1 − uptime)(1 − Slow Aura).
  eHP counts the damage reduction × uptime.

## Inner Land Mines (ILM)

- Wiki: N mines every cooldown that explode on contact for a multiple of
  tower damage as area damage (crit counts). **Cooldown hard capped at 37s.**
  Damage 10× → 9219× (36 levels), Quantity 3 → 6, Cooldown 200s → 50s.
  Perk: +6 mines outside the wall.
- **Charged Mine (ILM+)**: each mine's damage grows by ×0.5 → ×50.9 per
  second until it detonates; the charge never resets for a mine that's out.
- Labs: Blast Radius, Rotation Speed, Stun (2.4s), Chrono Jump (charge boost
  per enemy hit, needs ILM+).
- Model: Damage × (Quantity × activations [+ Space Displacer / Magnetic Hook
  mines]) × charge × tower damage × crit; cooldown ≥ 37s. Charge assumes a
  mine waits ~100s (about a boss interval).
- Not modeled: Chrono Jump, blast radius / stun.

## Golden Tower (GT)

- Wiki: while active, enemy kills give ×5.0 → ×21.0 cash and coins (21
  levels; GT Bonus lab +0.15/level to +3.75; perk ×1.5 on stat + lab).
  Duration 15s → 53s (39 levels, GT Duration lab +1s ×20), Cooldown 300s →
  100s.
- **Golden Combo (GT+)**, verified formula: bonus = (1 + 0.0003 × (level +
  1))^kills − 1 on the income earned during Golden Tower; only enemies that
  spawned during the activation count. 0.03% → 0.45% per kill.
- Golden Tower doesn't add damage — coins only (Farming model).

## Poison Swamp (PS)

- Wiki: a swamp that ticks every second for a multiple of tower damage (crit
  counts) while it lasts; poisoned enemies are 25% slower inside it. An enemy
  only takes damage from one swamp when swamps overlap.
- Damage 10× → 9219× (36 levels), Duration 30s → 100s, Cooldown 125s → 50s
  (not reduced by Galaxy Compressor). Perk: radius ×1.5.
- **Tick ramp** (wiki, from in-game hit text): every swamp ramps 50% a tick
  without PS+ — ticks 1×, 1.5×, 3×, 4.5×, 6×… (tick k ≥ 2 = (1 + r)(k − 1)).
  **Death Creep (PS+)** replaces r with 120% → 1110%.
- Labs: Radius +0.04/level ×30, Stun (5% chance, 1s) + Stun Chance (+2.5%) +
  Stun Time (+0.3s), Swamp Rend (+3% of applied rend per level, basics; the
  second lab adds enemy types).
- Model: Damage × coverage of tower range × duration × average tick × rend ×
  stun × activations × tower damage × crit.
- Not modeled: the 25% poisoned slow, overlap when duration > cooldown.

## Black Hole (BH)

- Wiki: pulls enemies in for a duration. **Its damage comes from the Black
  Hole Damage lab: 0.2% → 2% of the enemy's total health per second** (not
  tower damage; protectors don't reduce it). Size 30m → 70m, Duration 15s →
  38s (perk +12s), Cooldown 200s → 50s. Extra Black Hole lab adds a second
  hole opposite.
- **Consume (BH+)**: at the end of each activation, every enemy in it takes
  0.05× → 0.75× the current wave's HP.
- Spotlight doesn't multiply it (health-based).
- Model (calibrated score): reach = holes × uptime × size × lab %/s;
  Consume adds its share of enemy health on the kills made inside a Black
  Hole (98% of kills on a T18 farming run). The uncalibrated fallback still
  multiplies size by tower damage, which isn't how the game works.

## Spotlight (SL)

- Wiki: N lights of a given angle spin around the tower; enemies in them take
  ×8 → ×50 damage (31 levels; perk ×1.5). **It multiplies every damage source
  that isn't based on enemy health or wave stats** (so not Black Hole, Smite,
  Consume or orbs). Angle 30° → 90°, Quantity 1 → 4.
- **Light Range (SL+)**: the bonus gains 0.01× → 0.15× of damage per meter
  (tower range matters).
- Labs: Spotlight Missiles — the tower fires one missile every 19s (Lv 1) →
  2s (Lv 18), each dealing Smart Missiles' damage (14× without Smart
  Missiles); Spotlight Coin Bonus ×1.1 → ×3.0.
- Model: 1 + (bonus × perk + Light Range − 1) × (angle × quantity ÷ 360) on
  tower-damage sources.
