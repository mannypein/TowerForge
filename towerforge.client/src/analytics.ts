// ============================================================
//  TowerForge Companion — Analytics
//  Cookieless visit and event counts with Umami, self-hosted on
//  the TowerForge server (towerforge.net/analytics). The tracker
//  tag in index.html only reports from towerforge.net, so local
//  dev and previews send nothing. No personal data is sent.
//
//  Each tab has its own address (routes.ts), so the tracker's own
//  page views — it counts every address change — show which tabs
//  people use. Before 2026-10-20 tabs had no address and were
//  reported as "/<tab id>" (/whatif, /runcoins…).
