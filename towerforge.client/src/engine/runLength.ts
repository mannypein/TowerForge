// ============================================================
//  TowerForge Companion — Run length (run simulator, step 2)
//  How far a run gets, and how many waves more damage (Glass Cannon) or
//  more survival (eHP), or more level skip, would buy.
//
//  A GC tower dies to the first enemy that reaches it (one hit takes
//  all its health; Death Defy, Energy Shield and the wall only absorb a
//  few). So a run ends at the wave where enemies are too tough to kill
//  before they arrive: enemy health ÷ the tower's damage crosses a fixed
//  point. Enemy speed is capped by then, so that point doesn't move —
//  more damage moves the death wave to where enemy health has grown by
//  the same factor.
//
//  - Enemy health at death: the basic enemy at the run's own stat level
//    (wave − health levels skipped), by the formula checked against the
//    game (engine/enemyStats.ts). Only ratios matter, so perks and labs
//    that scale every enemy the same cancel out.
//  - Your limit: the geometric mean of that health over your latest
//    deaths on one tier (each run is a little luckier or unluckier).
//  - Level skips are deterministic, so health level = wave × (1 − rate).
//  Attack levels don't matter here: any hit is lethal either way.
//
//  eHP (`stat: 'attack'`): an eHP tower takes the hits, so its run ends
//  where enemy ATTACK outgrows what it can take — health, healing and
//  defense (engine/ehp.ts). Same model, on the basic enemy's attack at
//  the run's attack level (wave − AttackLevelSkips) and Enemy Attack
//  Level Skip: more survival moves the death wave to where enemy attack
//  has grown by the same factor. Checked on eHP players' saved runs
//  (2026-10-23, docs/run-simulation.md): where damage taken ≈ healing,
//  the attack at death holds steady run to run and tier to tier (one
//  account: within ×1.6 from T7 to T12, while enemy health at death
//  differed by thousands of times). Campaign only — the tournament attack
//  curve isn't known.
//  Pure functions — no store imports.
