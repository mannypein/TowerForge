//  TowerForge Companion — Ask AI: how it works
//  A panel at the top of the Ask AI page, in plain words for players who
//  aren't technical: what the AI is, what it needs, how an answer is made,
//  what it's bad at, and everything it keeps on the device or sends —
//  the opt-in reports (ai/aiLog.ts reportOf) and the anonymous counts
//  (countAnswer in ai/aiAssistant.ts, docs/analytics.md). When what's
//  sent changes, change it here too.

                    <li>The AI runs <strong>on your own computer</strong>, not on a server somewhere. It&apos;s free and needs no account.</li>
                    <li>It doesn&apos;t do the math. TowerForge works out every number with the same tools as the Optimizer and What If pages, and the AI explains them.</li>

                </ul>

                <h4>What it is</h4>
                <p>
                    The &quot;AI&quot; is a <strong>language model</strong>: a program that has learned to read and write text.
                    This one is <strong>Qwen3</strong>, a free, open model made by the Qwen team at Alibaba. It isn&apos;t
                    ChatGPT, and it doesn&apos;t talk to ChatGPT or any other service while it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It knows your account from what&apos;s already on TowerForge: the game data you imported, or the levels
                    you typed in. It never connects to the game, can&apos;t log in anywhere and can&apos;t change anything.
                </p>

                <h4>What you need</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A computer with Chrome or Edge.</strong> The AI thinks on your graphics card, through a
                        browser feature called WebGPU. Most gaming PCs and many laptops can do it; phones and tablets
                        usually can&apos;t yet. If yours can&apos;t, this page says so at the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A one-time download.</strong> The first time you press Start, your browser downloads the AI
                        from Hugging Face, the website where the model is published: {recommended.download} for
                        the recommended {recommended.label}, about the size of an HD movie. It&apos;s kept in your browser,
                        so next time it starts in a few seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A size that suits your computer.</strong> The models under Model below are the same AI in
                        different sizes: a bigger one answers better but needs a stronger graphics card.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How it answers a question</h4>
                <p>
                    Small AIs are good with words but bad at math, so the work is split: TowerForge does every
                    calculation, and the AI only picks what to look up and explains it. All four steps happen on your computer.
                </p>
                <ol className="ai-about-steps">
                    <li><strong>Read the question</strong>What kind of question is it — what to buy, &quot;what if I…&quot;, your runs, another tier? Plain ones TowerForge recognizes straight away; trickier ones the AI reads.<span>TowerForge or the AI</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Do the math</strong>TowerForge runs the same calculations as its own pages — Optimizer, What If, Run Length and the rest — on your account.<span>TowerForge</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Write the answer</strong>The AI gets those results and a short summary of your account, and writes the answer in plain words, told to use only those numbers.<span>The AI</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Check the numbers</strong>TowerForge checks every number in the answer. One it didn&apos;t work out itself gets a ⚠ under the answer.<span>TowerForge</span></li>
                </ol>
                <div className="ai-about-example">
                    <strong>For example</strong>, &quot;how many waves would maxing Chain Lightning damage get me?&quot; Step 1 sees
                    a &quot;what if&quot; question about Chain Lightning. Step 2 runs What If and gets, say, &quot;+4.2 waves, for
                    3,450 stones&quot;. Step 3 writes &quot;Maxing Chain Lightning damage would add about 4.2 waves…&quot;. Step 4
                    checks that 4.2 and 3,450 are TowerForge&apos;s numbers. (Made-up numbers, just for the example.)
                </div>
                <p>
                    Under each answer, <strong>Looked at</strong> shows everything TowerForge worked out for it, so you can see
                    where each number came from. When the answer tried some upgrades, <strong>Open in What If</strong> opens
                    them on the What If page.
                </p>

                <h4>What it&apos;s not good at</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>It can still be wrong.</strong> On our 94 test questions, about 9 in 10 answers were fully right.</li>
                    <li><strong>It sometimes invents a reason.</strong> Asked &quot;why&quot;, it can make up an explanation that sounds right.</li>
                    <li><strong>It only knows what TowerForge knows.</strong> If something isn&apos;t on TowerForge, the AI can&apos;t know it either.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>It needs your data.</strong> With nothing imported or typed in, it has little to go on — import
                        your game data first (the <ImportGuideLink>Import Guide</ImportGuideLink> shows how).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Your data: what stays, and what&apos;s sent</h4>
                <p>Because the AI runs on your computer, your questions don&apos;t need to go anywhere. Here is everything Ask AI keeps or sends, with nothing left out.</p>

                <div className="ai-about-box stays">
                    <div className="ai-about-tag">Stays on your computer</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The AI download</strong>, kept in your browser until you press Remove download.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your chat</strong>, gone when you close or reload the page, or press Clear.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Debug log</strong> at the bottom of this page: your last 200 questions, the answers, how long each took and your 👍/👎. Clear the log deletes it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your account&apos;s numbers</strong>, read in your browser. They&apos;re never sent anywhere to get an answer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div className="ai-about-box sent">
                    <div className="ai-about-tag">Sent only if you press Send</div>
                    <p>
                        When you press 👎 under an answer, TowerForge asks whether to send it, and says what&apos;s in it.
                        Nothing is sent unless you press <strong>Send</strong>. What it sends:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>your question and the AI&apos;s answer;</li>
                        <li>how TowerForge read the question, and what it looked up for it — which includes some of your account&apos;s numbers;</li>
                        <li>any numbers that got a ⚠;</li>
                        <li>the model, your kind of graphics card (like &quot;amd rdna-3&quot;) and the TowerForge version;</li>
                        <li>how long the answer took, and the note you type, if any;</li>
                        <li>your TowerForge username if you&apos;re signed in. If you&apos;re not, it&apos;s sent without a name.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Only the person who runs TowerForge reads them, to fix what went wrong. They&apos;re deleted after a year.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="ai-about-box sent">
                    <div className="ai-about-tag">Sent by itself, without your words</div>
                    <p>
                        After each answer, TowerForge adds one to a few counters, to see which kinds of questions people ask
                        and where answers go wrong — without seeing anyone&apos;s questions. A count says only:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the kind of question, like &quot;what to buy&quot; or &quot;what if&quot;;</li>
                        <li>whether TowerForge or the AI worked out what was asked;</li>
                        <li>whether a number got a ⚠;</li>
                        <li>roughly how long it took: under 10 seconds, 10–20, 20–40, or over 40;</li>
                        <li>the model, and whether something broke.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Never your question, the answer, your account, your username or anything you typed. It&apos;s the same
                        visitor counter TowerForge uses for page visits: no cookies, on TowerForge&apos;s own server.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h4>What Ask AI never collects</h4>
                <ul className="ai-about-never">
                    <li>Your questions or answers, unless you send one yourself.</li>

                    <li>Your TowerForge password.</li>
                    <li>Your name, email or anything personal — TowerForge accounts don&apos;t even have an email.</li>

                    <strong>The download:</strong> the first time, your browser fetches the AI from Hugging Face and the small
                    program that runs it from GitHub, the way any website loads a picture. They see a normal download, nothing
                    more — nothing is sent to them afterwards.
